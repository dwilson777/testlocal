# Acronyms Glossary

This is the glomex glossary of acronyms.

## CDN

**Content Delivery Network**

These are large networks of servers that have copies of data, pulled from an origin server, and are often geographically diverse in their location. The end user pulls the needed resources from the server that is closest to them, which is called an edge server. This process is done to decrease any delays that might be caused due to server proximity to the end user, as larger physical distances will result in longer delays, and ideally avoid congestion issues. Due to the resource intensive process of video streaming, most streaming platforms utilize a CDN.

## DRM

**Digital Rights Management**

Various access control technologies that are used to restrict usage of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies try to control the use, modification, and distribution of copyrighted works (such as software and multimedia content), as well as systems within devices that enforce these policies.

## HDS
**HTTP Dynamic Streaming**

Adobe’s HTTP Dynamic Streaming is an HTTP-based technology for adaptive streaming. It segments the video content into smaller video chunks, allowing switching between bit rates when viewing. 

## HLS
**HTTP Live Streaming**

Apple’s HTTP Live Streaming is an adaptive streaming technology. It functions by breaking down the stream into smaller MPEG2-TS files. These files vary by bitrate and often times resolution, and ideally are served to the viewer based on the criteria of their setup such as download speed.
