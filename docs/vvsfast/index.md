Prerequisites are also covered which are things you should know before reading the doc.

## What is the VVS Player?

The VVS Player is glomex's online video player. It has powerful features that enable the detection and prevention of ad-blocking software to help publishers maximise their ad revenue. Publishers can use the VVS Player as their primary video player. Or they can use it instead of their own player when ad-blocking software is detected. This is referred to as a fallback player. This Guide describes how to integrate the VVS Player into your own site as either the primary player or the fallback player.
