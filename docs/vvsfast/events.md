# Player Events
The `on()` function enables you to listen for a wide variety of events, including custom events that you can add.  See [CopyCode: Handling Player Events](onevents.md) for a code sample.

The VVS Player transmits its state based on a variety of events.  The transmissions includes:

* the trackingEventName (see [Tracking Event Names](../vvsref/events-tracking.md) for a detailed list of trackingEventNames)
* the payload (see [Event Payloads](../vvsref/payload-tracking.md) for detailed information about payload attributes)

A variety of additional reference information is provided for tracking events in the Player Reference.
